Early morning yellow flowers,
thinking abuot
the drunkards of Mexico.

No telegram today
only more leavs
fell.

Pounding rolling down the stairs,
someone’s coming home
eat, or play, or just relax

Nightfall,
boy smashing danddelions
with a stick.

Holding up my
purring cat to teh moon
I sighed.

Drunk as a hoot owl,
writing letters
by thundrestrom.

Empty baseball field
a robin
hops alongg the bench.

Elephants munching
on grass - loviing
Head side by side.

Missing a kick
at teh icebox door
It closed anyway.

Slowly, stretching, nimble paws
gently, twitching, our tail
You’re there and watching, I care.

This July evening,
a large frog
On my door sill.

Catfish fighting for his life,
and #winning,
Splashing us all.

I am nobody:
A red sinking autumn sun
Took my name away.

Keep straight down this block,
Then turn right where you will find
A peach tree blooming.

Make up you mind, Snail!
You are half inside your house,
And halfway out!

You moths must leave now;
I am turning out the light
And going to sleep.

All right, You Sparrows;
The sun has set and you can now
Stop your chattering!

Sparrow's excrement
Becomes quickly powdery
On sizzling pavements.

The dog's violent sneeze
Fails to rouse a single fly
On his mangy back.

On winter mornings
The candle shows faint markings
Of the teeth of rats.

With a twitching nose
A dog reads a telegram
On a wet tree trunk.

Sticking to my sweaty face
In the dusty woods.
